            <dt>What is the Global Compact Board Programme?</dt>
            <dd class="answer">
                <p>The Global Compact Board Programme is the first of its kind to align and support Boards of Directors to more effectively oversee and drive their company’s sustainability strategy, with a view to protect and support financial value creation. Through facilitating strategic discussions among the Board on pressing sustainability issues and how to evolve the role of the Board and corresponding governance tools, the Programme aims to help Boards to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Align on the strategic imperative and materiality of corporate sustainability as critical for the company’s long-term viability.</li>
                    <li>Realize the integral role that Board members can and should play in overseeing, incentivizing and driving corporate sustainability, embedding it into Board duties, governance mechanisms and structures.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate leadership on Board adoption and oversight of corporate sustainability with investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders.</li>

            <dt>Who should participate in the Board Programme?</dt>
            <dd class="answer">
                <p>The Global Compact Board Programme is designed specifically for the elected or appointed members of the organizational body whose duty is to oversee, but not manage, the activities of the company. In many countries this body is called the Board of Directors, but in other countries is sometimes called the Board of Governors or the Supervisory Board. Board duties vary greatly across countries and jurisdictions, but typically include oversight of business strategy, risk management and legal compliance, as well as the recruitment and compensation of the chief executive.</p>

            <dd class="answer">
                <p>To ensure maximum impact and adequate level of discussion, the Board Programme is to be delivered in-house and organized in two module sessions, each three to four hours long. A minimum of 50% of the time is devoted to facilitated discussions among Board members.</p>

            <dt>Why was the Global Compact Board Programme created?</dt>
            <dd class="answer">
                <p>Board adoption and oversight of corporate sustainability, while on the rise in some respects, represents an area where vast improvement and gains can be achieved. In an effort to accelerate the full integration of corporate sustainability into business strategy and operations, the Global Compact Board Programme was created.</p>
                <p>By embedding sustainability into its core duties – notably setting strategic course, risk management and monitoring, executive recruitment, and remuneration – Directors are uniquely positioned to ensure the full mainstreaming of sustainability into business strategy and practices in a way that will support the long-term profitability and viability of the company. The more a Director knows about sustainability issues and their management implications, the more likely he or she is to prioritize them as important to the company.</p>
                <p>In fact, as the material impact of non-financial issues is recognized, leaders around the world are beginning to acknowledge that the fiduciary duty of Boards of Directors includes a responsibility to effectively manage risks and opportunities related to corporate sustainability and to respond to the interests and concerns of all stakeholders.</p>

                <p>The recommended size of the company team is three to four representatives. As a minimum, the team should consist of a sustainability lead and a representative from the Secretariat to the Board of Directors. It is also recommended that the Programme delivery and preparation are actively sponsored by a C-suite executive to ensure efficient management alignment. The company is required to ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to support interviews, questionnaires or gathering other necessary data in a timely manner.</p>

            <dd class="answer">
                <p>A world-class facilitator is key to the successful delivery of the Global Compact Board Programme. Companies will have the opportunity to choose from a roster of professional facilitators from a variety of industries, with corporate governance and sustainability expertise.</p>
                <p>Acknowledging the importance of industry-specific dynamics, facilitators are selected based on their ability to combine global and local contexts, as well as to understand the nuance of corporate governance in different jurisdictions. Over time, the roster will grow to include facilitators with fluency in all six United Nations languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish). Seasoned business executives, such as members of the Global Compact Board, will also be invited to support the delivery of the Programme on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Global Compact ensures that all candidates listed on the Facilitator Roster are knowledgeable about the Board Programme content and well qualified for Board-level discussion.</li>
                    <li>If a participating company has its own suggestions for facilitators not yet on the official roster, the Global Compact welcomes the opportunity to consider, but reserves the right to accept or decline the suggested candidates after an assessment of experience and expertise.</li>
